HR & Payroll system
-------------------

Getting set up
==============

After cloning this repo locally, you will need to get the Vagrant VM up and running. For
this, you will need [Oracle VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and
[Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) installed.

Once they are installed, activate the prescribed VM:

```bash
$ cd hrp
$ vagrant up
```

This will start the download of the Dev VM image - about 470MB in total.
